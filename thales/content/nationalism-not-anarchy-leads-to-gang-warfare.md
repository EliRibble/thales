Title: Nationalism, not Anarchy, leads to gang warfare

One of the images people generally have of anarchy is roving gangs of armed warriors abusing, destroying and generally terrorizing everyone. Here, let’s paint a picture…

> Tomorrow you wake up and discover that all government has vanished. There are no police officers, no governors, no legislators, no taxman, no government. Gone. Whammo-bammo, anarchy. Immediately you wonder about your safety. Will some crazy people come knocking on your door, looking for food, fire and fun? You wait nervously for several days, until a group of your neighbors approaches you. Apparently a local leader, Jet, has been stockpiling weapons. Jet is willing to protect you and your family, if you just listen to what he tells you to do and send him some money to support his troops. You make an arrangement with his delegates, agreeing to provide 100$ a month to him in exchange for his people patrolling your house once a week and responding to any distress call. Things go great.
>
> Several months pass. You start to hear rumors of other neighborhoods setting up similar systems. Jet’s leadership has worked so far. He asked the people raising chickens to reduce how many they raised, as it was starting to smell and several were dying of disease from overcrowding. In fact, Jet publishes a monthly newsletter informing people of what his suggestions are for how they live and telling them of what is going on in the neighborhood.
>
> More months pass. You’re more and more pleased with your choice to join a gang for safety. Then, one day, a messenger comes by your house. Apparently a nearby gang has decided to steal part of your gang’s lucrative chicken operation. The messenger indicates they are probably ‘those kind’ of people who hate law and order like you guys have. Jet has asked for 300$ for supplies for the troops. Oh, and he’ll need any able-bodied men ages 18-25. Fortunately, you’re a bit old. You hand over your $300, grateful that Jet will take care of you and keep the world safe.
>
> As time passes, you realize that there is constantly a threat of violence from one gang or another. Jet is constantly levying funds from everyone under protection to meet these threats. You know of some neighborhood young men who have died in the fights. But, the fights are generally kept distance by Jet’s aggressive paroling. And, furthermore, things are orderly, so long as you don’t break on of Jet’s rules. One guy did that and Jet locked him up for a whole month! Thank goodness you’ve found a way to survive this anarchy…


What I have described is, at it’s essence, the gang war that people fear from anarchy. People able to attack one another, willy-nilly. Constant threat of danger. Arbitrary rules from tyrants who extract money from people.

What I have also described is the Western world, including the USA.

Change Jet for Uncle Sam, and it’s exactly the same. Uncle Sam establishes rules, takes your money, sends young men off to die in wars that he may or may not have started, uses the specter of violence to extract more and more obedience and power. The vast difference, people believes, is that Uncle Sam is somehow ‘good’. Or ‘turstworthy’. Or, they have the ‘rule of law’. I don’t know what it is. Does a bully with an elaborate system of rules used to determine his behavior act any less a bully? Is a gang with a rotating leadership that is popularly elected any less a gang? There are still fights for turf, arbitrary taking of liberty and property (for varying definitions of arbitrary – in California can you, or can you not smoke pot? Guess it depends on whether that’s a state law enforcement officer or a federal one you’re talking to)

The truth is, at the end of everything, in an absence of government you could, conceivably, choose to stop paying Jet and he would stop choosing to protect you. He might also choose to come raid your house for the money. And you’d be left defending yourself. Oh, wait, that’s just like what would happen with Uncle Sam. So what is the difference?

The difference would lie entirely in the people around you. In a nationalistic system, failure to pay taxes means that you are some kind of revolutionary, or a freeloader, or some other terrible type of person who deserves whatever he gets for breaking the ‘Rule of Law’.  Violence is therefore justified against you. In an anarchist society, the populace would support you (if not materially, at least ideologically..maybe) for wanting to leave a voluntary association with Jet. Oh, you’d still have to fight him if he chose to get nasty. But at least your neighbors wouldn’t think horrible things about you.

Maybe you could even convince them to help you protect yourself.

So, in summary, don’t fear gang warfare. You already enjoy it – you just think there are good reasons for it.
