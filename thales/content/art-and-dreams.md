Arthur, I’m pleased that you came to me with this problem. Your situation is perfectly indicative of why Keynesian economics simply does not work. You see, the Keynesians would have thought that if they lowered the interest rate enough, nothing could have kept you from not only buying a home, but buying several homes. They just have no concept of how humans do things for motives other than carefully scripted financial ones. Frankly, humans are highly varied in their motives and methods, and only a completely free market and sound currency can serve them properly.

As for your actual question, the answer lies in understanding your primary responsibility. Actually, I’ve changed my mind – I can no more dictate to you what your responsibility is than Lord Keynes can. What I will tell you is this: children represent a fascinating investment opportunity. We all understand the compounded value of a simple investment faithfully made early. Your children currently require a small amount of food. If you faithfully provide that, some day you will be old and they will be worth a lot. You could have them take care of you, sell them, or even harvest them for organs. Now, you could ignore this investment opportunity, which is only available to you as a parent, to pursue your artistic muse, or you could make the minimum payments necessary to realize a large gain in your portfolio later on. I’m not suggesting you have to abandon your art completely – small children really don’t eat very much – just that you could abandon enough of it to provide what your children need. Say, for instance, that you paint for 7 hours a day and work at some kind of restaurant or food service industry that provides discounts for employees another 3 hours a day. That’s only 10 hours a day of work, and the majority, over 69%, devoted to your art.

Really, the important thing to remember here is that your work is not an all-or-nothing proposition. You have many assets you could put on the open market alongside your artistic output. It takes creativity and persistence to pursue the many paths available to you. Diversification is the path to stability and prosperity.

Oh, and fortune cookies lie.
