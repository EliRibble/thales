Call me [Thales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales). Welcome to Thales’ blog at [TheHumanAscent](http://www.thehumanascent.com/)! I’m excited to be here. I’ll be your scribe, host, confidante, guide, friend, chef and lover. Or at least I’ll educate you. My purpose here is to help those of you who are lost in life to find your destination. Perhaps you’re lost in love. Maybe you’re lost in finances. Maybe you just can’t figure out how to sell you used Suzuki Boulevard and you need a hand. Thales (that’s me) is here to help.

Here’s how this works. You email me a question at [my email address](mailto:thales@thehumanascent.com). I answer your question here as faithfully as I can. That’s it, it’s easy! Ideally you’ll check back here for your answer and your life will be significantly improved, along with the lives of all of my dear readers. By voluntarily working together on a blog, we can not only improve each of our own lives, but amortize the costs over all present and future readers.

Hey yo! What is your e-mail address? Maybe you should make a link to your email where it says “my email address” at the top of the second paragraph. I have a whopper of a question that I Would like to post but I want to make sure I go through the right channels. By the way I am making a poster of you to hang on my wall… so what do you look like?

I look forward to your reply.

Well, thanks for the useful suggestion. I really *should* have my email posted somewhere. I’ll get around to fixing that. Meanwhile, you can send me your questions at thales@thehumanascent.com.

As for the poster, please reference my highly accurate [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales). I made it myself.

Hello Mr. Thales,

Do you accept non-political questions? If so, I have one. I am getting married a month (yay). My fiancee currently does not work, rather he goes to school. He has not saved any money for a downpayment on a house. I have saved some money for a downpayment and I have a good job. I want to buy a house, which we are able to aford on my salary. However, several people have told me that because he isn’t working or contributing to the downpayment, I should only put the house in my name. I already told him jokingly that he didn’t’ get to help pick (I’m so bad) the house and he got upset. I’m afraid that if I tell him it’s not going to be in his name, he might get really offended.

What do you think I should do?
