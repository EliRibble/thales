Title: Practical Anarchy: The lack of world government

There are many people who believe that a system without compulsory government cannot work. People are evil, roving gangs of marauders, utter lack of organization, etc. To those people, I would say “How, then, does the world operate without a world government?” You see, nations can be thought of a as a single, monolithic entity, much like people. There is, currently, no binding world government to control those entities. Instead, the entities create spontaneous order through their various interactions. Those interactions are controlled by diverse forces and whims, much like an individual’s thoughts and feelings. This is true because they are simply aggregates of people. The governments of the world engage in trade, warfare, legal proceedings, contracts (treaties) and do all of the things that humans do – except reproduce – without a coercive government.

If you wonder what Anarchy, or the lack of a coercive government would look like, look at the interactions between nations. That is exactly what it would look like. If this depresses you, consider how you would feel if the United States were invaded by the U.N., with the U.N. declaring that they had authority to come in, tax the U.S. citizenry and inspect all of their commerce to make sure it followed their rules. If you do not feel this way about the U.S. government doing the same thing to your personal property, you are philosophically inconsistent.

Hello Thales,

You are oversimplifying in this post. If you take 200 individuals and put them in a huge space where they don’t have to talk to each other very often most of the time that can get along. Because they are so few they don’t need a government because they can just discuss among themselves.

In reality there are over 6 billion people in the world. Each of those people has their own ideas, needs, wants, philosophies… It is unreasonable to compare the two.

Further I would like to take issue with your general conception of anarchy.

After reading your posts it is clear to me that you are looking at anarchy in a very mathematical way. Oppressed people – government = free people. The anarchy you describe would work very well if every person lived on at least one acre, new every one of their neighbors, didn’t move or plan to move, and didn’t have strong religious or moral drives.

This is just not the case. Lets go to the city of New York and see how these conditions are not met and see the potential conflicts.

Every weekday morning 3 million people travel from the New York area to Manhattan island for work and other purposes. Most of those three million people have no bond whatsoever; they don’t know each other, they don’t live in the same place, they don’t go to the same church, the don’t share the same beliefs, they don’t all speak the same language, they don’t eat the same, they don’t all have similar lifestyles, they are all very different from each other. If all of a sudden they were responsible to govern themselves based on solely individual standards of conduct the whole system would shut down. There wouldn’t even be a way to move those three million people, because there would be no foundation for negotiation. Why should you make agreements with people you don’t know and frankly don’t care about, not to mention there isn’t the time. Imagine in the subway ten people have nicely spread themselves across one of the cars, they come to a busy station and people start to enter. “Wait a second you can’t come in here because you are violating my space.”
“I need to get home you can’t stop me from getting on this train.”
“No no, you can’t push your way in because that would be using force against me.” The door closes and the ten people sit back down to enjoy their ride home.

Some visitors from Japan are driving down the wrong side of the road.
“Stop you are driving on the wrong side of the road.”
“No you are driving on the wrong side of the road.” conflict.
It doesn’t have to be armed gangs wandering about enforcing their way, it can also be people who can’t communicate anymore because there is no standard of comparison. You might be thinking right now, well there would be a standard of comparison because right minded people would find consensus among themselves and they would voluntarily abide by those rules. But that doesn’t happen overnight and a moving body of three million people have a hard time communicating.

Okay lets say that the world has fallen apart, and we have the decision to make a government the way we want starting from scratch. There is no way that enough people are going to agree on a strict anarchy that it could ever be effective. Culture is more of a motivator than government ever was. As soon as the opporunity presents itself the faithfull Muslims will beggin sheria law. That means all talkfiri (non muslims) must pay jizra (taxes) to the muslims.
“Well I am not going to pay taxes to you it is my property and I will not volentarily give it up to your supposed god.”
“Well to bad because Allah told us we can take it so just step in line.”
“You can’t do that because you can’t use force because we live in anarchy.”
“Right, you live in anarchy but we are living Alla’s law.”
The Muslims would not be enforcing their Sharia law because they are mean or wish to do harm but because they were commanded by their god to do so; and who is any anarchist against god?

There are thousands of other cultures that feel just as strongly about their faiths their morals; millions of people who believe abortion is so wrong that they will protect the rights of the unborn at all costs. There are people who think that homosexuality, or drugs, or Christianity, or Islam, or sex cults, or money are so wrong they will not sit by and let it happen. The only way to maintain anarchy would be to use force which would be against the point of anarchy.

The reason why central government works in huge and diverse populations is because we don’t have to focus on our relationships ~with~ only our relationships ~to~. Instead of every individual trying to work out the complex clash of culture with every other individual around, all individuals can focus on working out their issues with a singular central force. And in order for it to work that force or government has to rein supreme; everyone has to buy into it or it wont work. Since the majority of people want the system to work they will authorize this independent force to tie up the loose ends.

This doesn’t mean we have to have a huge government that medals with other governments, or that the government should be responsible for the general welfare of the people it governs, but it needs to be in place as a standard and foundation for all people to build upon.

The nature of humans is organic not mathematical. As long as people are free to make choices and think for themselves anarchy will not work on a large scale.

Thanks for the long comment. I appreciate the time and effort such a thing requires. I’ll attempt to answer in a coherent way

> You are oversimplifying in this post. If you take 200 individuals and put them in a huge space where they don’t have to talk to each other very often most of the time that can get along. Because they are so few they don’t need a government because they can just discuss among themselves.

You would agree that 6 billion people is logistically the same as 5 billion people, right? What about 4? What about 3? At what point do the logistics of a large body of people become ‘unreasonable to compare’ to a small body of people?

You have posited that in a small system of 200 sovereign agents, peace is maintained by a lack of communication and a presence of distance. The United States and Canada have peace in spite of being as close to each other as two nations can be. They have had peace for a very long time. How is this accomplished without distance? As to whether or not they have a lack of communication – they speak a common language, or close enough, but I suppose each nation can decide for itself if it communicates with the other.

> After reading your posts it is clear to me that you are looking at anarchy in a very mathematical way. Oppressed people – government = free people. The anarchy you describe would work very well if every person lived on at least one acre, new every one of their neighbors, didn’t move or plan to move, and didn’t have strong religious or moral drives.

Mathematical, perhaps. I think principled would be a more accurate description. I define a principle, and if I take it to be true, I take it to always be true. Otherwise, it serves no purpose and should be discarded in favor of a better principle. For instance, you have defined my logical equation one way. I would discard it in favor of a superior definition: People oppressed by government – government = people no longer oppressed by government. This is a more precise definition, and more correct in more circumstances.

I see no reason why space and familiarity are necessary to order. You likely don’t know all of your neighbors, I certainly don’t, but I don’t hold the fallacious assumption that we have order because at any time I could exercise governmental coercion over their behavior. Rather, I assume that they honor principles similar to my own, and generally think similarly to how I think. This makes their behavior predictable, and with that I can make choices that affect them or are affected by them without knowing them. Those assumptions, of course, carry an amount of risk, but I willingly accept that risk.

I fail to see why movement has anything to do with the ability of people to generate spontaneous order. Perhaps you assume that in moving elsewhere you would encounter neighbors with vastly different value systems that would cause them to value initiating violence against you. If so, I would recommend allocating resources to your own defense. Either that, or making a more informed decision about where you move. A coercive government doesn’t make you safe from all the bogeymen out there – it simply replaces some unknown bogeymen with known ones. And, even then, you are assuming that governmental officials in one location will administer law in a way you expect, which is just as fallacious as assuming that culture would be the same. After all, any principle that is true of people in general must, by definition, be true of government people. If you cannot trust your fellow man, you cannot trust your fellow man armed with a gun and a badge, because he too is a man!

Why? You have just described the world of sovereign nations – how are they different and still have order? Would you prefer a single world government to the current system? What if that government were vastly different from the one you are used to? Variety, yes, is dangerous, but so is homogeneity.

What do you believe the current foundation of negotiation to be? Is it the fact that if these people don’t negotiate, the police will step in and force them to negotiate? Negotiation happens because two people are interested in an exchange. That happens in anarchy as much as it does in coercive government (assuming the government isn’t using coercion on the participants – then it’s not really negotiation).

In your example, what would the current government system do differently? People are just as free to make those statements now as they would be under anarchy. And people would be just as free to enter one anothers’ space, outside of assualting them.

It is in the train-operator’s best interest to keep all passengers happy, and their commerce generally flowing. In such a situation, they might decide to hire some private security to monitor the train. If some customers are out of line, the security would step in and ask the uncooperative customers to leave. The customers could refuse to do so, but at this point they are violating the train operator’s property rights. The operator, therefore, is justified in forceably removing them from the premises, allowing their other passengers to continue to enjoy their services.

Yes, conflict is a natural part of human interaction. But giving a single bully power over deciding how conflict is decided is not necessarily optimum. After all, if you give a single bully power to decide everything, what happens when the bully has a conflict with you? You lose.

> You might be thinking right now, well there would be a standard of comparison because right minded people would find consensus among themselves and they would voluntarily abide by those rules. But that doesn’t happen overnight and a moving body of three million people have a hard time communicating.

I agree, consensus doesn’t happen overnight, conflicts are not immediately resolved and 3 million people have difficulty communicating. How would coercive government change that?

> Okay lets say that the world has fallen apart, and we have the decision to make a government the way we want starting from scratch. There is no way that enough people are going to agree on a strict anarchy that it could ever be effective. Culture is more of a motivator than government ever was.

> “Right, you live in anarchy but we are living Alla’s law.”
> The Muslims would not be enforcing their Sharia law because they are mean or wish to do harm but because they were commanded by their god to do so; and who is any anarchist against god?

I totally agree – the Muslims would be totally justified in voluntarily creating sharia law. They could even agree that they want to impose it on me. They could feel entirely justified. None of that puts an onus on me to bend over and let them have their way with me. They would try to force me to pay jizra. I would refuse. They would attack me. I would defend myself. This is the danger of being sovereign. I accept that danger.

Anarchy does not claim there are not violent people. My definition of anarchy only claims a consistent set of principles by which to govern human interaction. Would it be more appropriate for you to create a coercive government and force Muslims to pay taxes for a government they believe is evil in order to keep yourself safe? How then are you any different from them? Is your system of violence better because it isn’t based on belief in Allah?

You can either choose to implement stronger evil against evil, or to implement good.

> There are thousands of other cultures that feel just as strongly about their faiths their morals; millions of people who believe abortion is so wrong that they will protect the rights of the unborn at all costs. There are people who think that homosexuality, or drugs, or Christianity, or Islam, or sex cults, or money are so wrong they will not sit by and let it happen. The only way to maintain anarchy would be to use force which would be against the point of anarchy.

I apologize then, for I must have poorly defined anarchy for you to think that it excludes the use of force. It does not. It excludes the initiation of force. Anarchists are perfectly justified in defensively killing their attackers. This would includes homosexuals, drugs, Christians, Muslims, sex cultists and capitalists.

> The reason why central government works in huge and diverse populations is because we don’t have to focus on our relationships ~with~ only our relationships ~to~.

And in order for it to work that force or government has to rein supreme; everyone has to buy into it or it wont work. Since the majority of people want the system to work they will authorize this independent force to tie up the loose ends.

You raise several interesting points in this statement.
1. – I agree that if you completely empower a single bully, everyone must deal with that bully completely, likely to the exclusion of other relationships. What happens when the bully decides to bully you? You lose.
1. – Why is it preferrable to deal with a single large bully? True, there is less complexity in that you don’t have to manage many small relationships. But, you have the added complexity of managing a single large relationship.
1. – Why must everyone buy in to the single governmental force in order for it to work? I do not condone a coercive government. Does my government cease to work? Or do I cease to live free because the government refuses to allow me?
1. – Even if the majority of people want a particular system, from where do they derive the authority to force others to cooperate?
1. – In empowering a government, you are in actuality empower people. Why is it that a single person with a monopoly on force must, by nature, behave better than many people using force? If you think a single person will rob you for your food, why do you think a government single person would not?

> This doesn’t mean we have to have a huge government that medals with other governments, or that the government should be responsible for the general welfare of the people it governs, but it needs to be in place as a standard and foundation for all people to build upon.

Why is the use of force a standard and foundation? Could not a set of principles be a similar foundation to build upon? Having order is about having a reliable set of assumptions. Those assumptions do not necessarily have to be based on violence. They can be based on common culture, common principles, or contract. Any of these could be a basis for a foundation for assumptions, and therefore commerce and society.

> As long as people are free to make choices and think for themselves anarchy will not work on a large scale.

Therefore, the only way to have a large scale system is by a) threatening violence against people who do not follow a central plan or b) removing people’s ability to make choices. Of course, I’m making a semantic point here – when you use coercion, you are attempting to limit people’s choices through threat of violence, so ‘a’ and ‘b’ are really the same.

I appreciate the thoughtful dialogue. This is so much better than the namecalling you see on other political sites. Let me throw my one cent in. If there is no government and my next door neighbor is raping and abusing his children (it happens more often that we think), who can stop it? What authority do I have to go in and stop it? Can I use force to go in and take those kids? What if I only suspect it? What if I have reasonable cause to suspect it, but no real evidence? Can I go in? The vulnerable have no way to defend themselves. If there is no Government, wouldn’t there be no law? and if there is no law, how can we stop this neighbor? Sometimes force must be used. A person can use force to defend himself, but what about the weak? I don’t think it’s wrong for a group to be given authority to use force to protect the vulnerable. That’s the Government. Now, if we give them authority to use force, what’s going to stop them from abusing that authority? I think the key is transparency. The watchmen need to be watched. If they abuse the power we give them, then they are forced out and someone new is brought in. Am I wrong here? This is a quickly typed e-mail (sorry if it’s scatterbrained), but what are your responses?

Good questions – I’ll respond in a separate post
