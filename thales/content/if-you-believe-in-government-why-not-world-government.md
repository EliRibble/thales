Title: If you believe in government, why not World Government?

I was recently made aware of a fascinating argument I’d like to share. It goes like this:

```
National government    World Government

——————————————————  =  ———————————————

Citizens               Nations
```

You should read that as “As national government is to its citizens, so world government is to it’s constituent nations”. The idea is this: you believe that a national government is valid. That is, that a government can impose legitimacy on its people.

“Wait wait wait! Back the train up! I never said government can impose legitimacy on its people!” you say.

Well, do you believe that I, as a sovereign human being can declare myself free of the national government? That I can then go about my business on the land that I own, not paying taxes, not following laws, because I have chosen not to have a government control me? If you don’t believe that is true, you either believe that 1) I should leave the government’s land first, surrendering my property (which means you believe that the government owns all property) or 2) that the government has a right to impose itself on me, regardless of my choices. That is, that a government still has legitimate authority without my consent. Imposed legitimacy. I will show that with either position, you then support a world government.

First, let us assume that you follow 1 – that the government owns all property, and therefore I must leave the government’s legitimately owned property in order to be free of their control. Where did the government get claim to all property? Either a) it took the property by force, and is therefore a thief, and has no legitimate claim b) original property owners transferred ownership to it or c) it has original claim to property.

If you believe ‘a’, I have nothing more to say to you. You are essentially a bully, believing that a government can bully people out of their property, then legitimately bully people out of freedom on the claim of their false property rights.

If you believe ‘b’, I would like to know who the original property owners were, and what documentation shows the transfer of ownership. I know of nothing like that for my own government, but perhaps yours is different. Likely not.

If you believe ‘c’, you must believe then that either government has some fundamental original claim to land because it is a government, or that some government claimed previously unclaimed land in the name of the government. The former means that you believe a world government has an even better fundamental claim and the latter means that you’re a subject of the original government of mankind, which is neat. After all, if you were a British subject, you would, of necessity realize that the British government must have taken their property rights from some government that preceded it, like the Romans, who in turn assumed their property rights from some other government, and so on back to the dawn of the first bureaucracy. Like I said, neat.

Now, to get back to my point. You either believe that a nation can impose legitimacy, or you do not. If you do believe that, then you believe that a world government has a right to impose legitimacy on the nations of the world. If you do not, then you would agree that a state has the right to secede from a federal government based on their own, inalienable rights. If a state can do it, then a city can do it. If a city can do it, then a neighborhood can do it. If a neighborhood can do it, then a house can do it. If a house can do it, a man can do it. Therefore, there is no legitimate government, without the consent of the governed.

You see, you are either an anarchist, or you are a supporter of world government. Or, I suppose, you could be one of those spineless jellyfish that prefer not to base their judgments on principles, but instead on what feels good.
