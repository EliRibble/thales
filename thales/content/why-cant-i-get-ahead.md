Judy, thanks for the question – you certainly managed to get ahead by being the first question posted here on my blog!

To get to the heart of your question you have to realize that your desire for ‘getting ahead’ is based entirely in your public education in the United States. You may be wondering how I knew your background. You shouldn’t. The United States, like most hegemonies, has created a successful machine for mass-producing widgets of a specific type. The widgets the education system produces are people who are perpetually ensconced in a fascinating dichotomy. You want to be the ‘best’, and yet you lack the self-confidence and internal direction to answer this question: “best what?”.

As a youth you were taught that all people can be boiled down to a simple mathematical comparison of numbers indicating their worth. In childhood it’s your grade. In adulthood, it’s your net worth. Perhaps you disagree and believe that you see people as individuals. Maybe you’re religious. Does your religion teach you that God loves everyone? That’s the government’s approach – everyone is worth one vote. Does your religion teach you that God will judge people and categorize them based on their conduct? That’s the pedagogues’s approach – everyone’s conduct is precisely rateable as a number, or a categorization like ‘A’, ‘B’, or ‘F’. Of course, I mean pedagogue from the modern definition of the word – one who studies [pedagogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy), rather than the ancient term. If you are not religious, ask yourself who you respect more: a teacher, or a brewer.

.. have you asked the question? Do you have an answer?

I’ve given no more information about these individuals than their labels – how can you possibly rate them?

What I’m getting at is that you should check your assumptions. You fail to ‘get ahead’ because the system is designed to prevent all but the [Brahmin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin) from doing so. If you fail to get ahead, it is because you are not part of the elite class. You may now join your peers in the middle class in whatever menial labor the system has dictated to you.

So long as your objective is dictated by the system, your will be slave to the system.

A better question would be, first, “Why do I believe money is important?” Fiat currency doesn’t provide life, or even anything of material value, until you find someone who is foolish enough to believe it has value. You then get them to give you material goods in exchange for your empty promise from the government. Once you realize how unimportant money is, and how strongly you’ve been conditioned to believe it is important, you can begin the process of discovering what you do value. Come back when you’ve learned that important truth and we can discuss how you can effectively pursue it.
