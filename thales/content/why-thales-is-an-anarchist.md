…and why you should be too.

I work from a set of a few, very simple, very profound principles. Here they are, insofar as I can enumerate them accurately:

1. No one has a right to perform violence on another person, except in defense against violence initiated by another
1. Men may gain a right to property through two means a) if a thing is unowned, by improving upon or using that thing or b) if a thing is owned, agreeing with the owner on a transfer of ownership
1. A man has ultimate and exclusive right to property he owns – he may use it, destroy it, or transfer it to another.

That is, essentially, ‘it’. I believe that if these principles are taken for a basis for political thought, many interesting principles fall out of it. But, before we get there, why do I believe these axioms?

The first can be based entirely in pragmatism – man only has one major predator that we have encountered in the universe: man. Therefore, the first axiom prevents man from fearing its only predator.

The second is based on the fact that the universe predates man, and each individual man. But, we must all use stuff in the universe, and we need to do so in a way that keeps man from having to fear man. We must have organization. We invent the concept of ‘property’ to define who may use what in the universe without conflict with our great predator. It would have been extremely useful for the first man to take ownership of everything, then to parcel that out to his offspring. Then property would always be defined by axiom 3. Unfortunately, even if this was done, the actual organization was lost to history. Therefore, we need a new way of divvying out stuff. Since all mankind is essentially equal, it makes sense that all property is allocated on an equal basis. If a thing was owned, the owner must willingly transfer ownership in whatever form he wishes. If a thing isn’t owned, usage or improvement of it constitutes a claim of ownership. This prevents people from simply declaring that they own everything unowned, and allows people who find a new, unused thing to assume ownership.

Finally, the third prevents people from having a fear of ownership. After all, if a person were prohibited from, say, burning something they own because it would destroy it, then the person doesn’t truly own it, but rather whoever can enforce the ‘no-burning’ clause. That is because the enforcer can burn a thing and choose not to enforce the rule, thus giving them a superset of ownership rights, and therefore ultimate ownership. I have not encountered a way of enforcing limited property rights that is not subject to abuse by some party, where abuse means a single person has greater ownership rights. Therefore, the only sensible definition of ownership is the maximal set of rights. Otherwise, we have no equality. If a thing is mine, I can do what I want with it. If it were otherwise, there would be enforcers, and I would have a fear to use my thing because of them.

Aside form these axioms, people may do whatever they wish. This means a person is free to traffic in drugs, people, organs, hate, religion, etc. They may not do so in a way that infringes on another’s right to property. I cannot build a factory that pollutes a stream, unless I own the stream. Even then, my pollution cannot spread to the ocean, unless I own the ocean. And then, I could not allow my pollution to spread through condensation to another’s farmland. Where there is ultimate freedom, there is also ultimate responsibility not to infringe on another’s freedom.

Taking these axioms, we can then describe a government that obeys these axioms.

 * The government cannot force anyone to do anything against their will – otherwise, they would violate axiom #1
 * The government cannot assume ownership of anything from anyone – otherwise they would violate axiom #2
 * The government cannot prevent people from using a thing they own however they like – otherwise they would violate axiom #3
 * The government could have employees – people are free to associate how they wish
 * The government could own property – it could be given to the government

So how does this equate to anarchy? Well, the government cannot levvy taxes against me, though I could donate to it. The government cannot seize my land, or dictate to me what I do with my land, but I could choose to follow its recommendations. The government cannot imprison me for breaking a law, because it cannot use violence against me, and I will not go willingly into a prison. This government, then, has no power. It cannot dictate what I can do, nor take away my means to do it, in any situation. This government, then, is nothing more than a private entity I could choose to do business with.

After all, what separates governments from businesses? The use of force.

Take away the use of force, and you have no government. Take away government, and you have anarchy.

I would also suggest Block, Walter. 2007. “[Anarchism and Minarchism; No Rapprochement Possible: Reply to Tibor Machan](http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/21_1/21_1_5.pdf),” Journal of Libertarian Studies, Vol. 21, No. 1, Spring, pp. 91–99 for further reading.

This argument is interesting. I would say it all pans out until you begin to consider land as ownable property. Ownership of land is not a natural right. Since land existed before man (as you stated in your argument) no man has a right to own any land at all. Interestingly the ownership of land by individuals is a relatively recent phenomenon.

Let me give you a few real-world examples of why this is the case.

Suppose that a stream runs through two pieces of land owned by different farmers. In order for the upstream farmer to support his family sufficiently he needs to divert the stream to irrigate his fields. However by diverting the stream no water reaches the land of the other farmer to water his fields. The downstream farmer can claim that the upstream farmer is violating his rights by damaging his property. But the upstream farmer can claim that if he lets the water run down stream the downstream farmer would be damaging his property. Neither farmer is being irresponsible or unreasonable, but their situation can’t be reconciled. One farmers property is maintained at the expense of the other; which, according to your argument, would give one farmer ownership over the other farmers property.

Second: California has many many rice fields which produce millions of mosquitoes. These mosquitoes are a nuisance and a health threat. Say that a certain woman owns some land that she would like to build a hotel on for people who are visiting that part of California. The rice farmer has a right, according to your argument, to grow rice to support his family or increase his wealth. The woman has a right to build a hotel on her property to make money to support her family and to build wealth. During the growing season, which is the peak tourist season, the farmer irrigates his fields which produce millions of mosquitoes. Tourists refuse to visit the hotel because of the mosquitoes. The farmer is causing real measurable damage to the womans property which she has a right to use as she wishes. However the farmer has a right to use his property as he wishes. Neither land owner can succeed without damaging to property and wellbeing of the other land owner.

Anarchy can’t work if land is considered an individuals property. Therefore a person’s only property would be those things which he or she produces that can be kept without restricting the land use of others. This actually works but only on a small scale. People formed governments party in order to peacefully settle land disputes. (of course “peacefully” means they threatened one or both parties with violence if they didn’t comply with the decision of the government, which invariably favors the wealthy.)

### Thales says (2010-09-13 3:01pm)

Thank you for your well-thought-out comment.

I agree that if you consider land unownable, you greatly simplify interactions between mankind. I disagree that Anarchy is impossible while allowing people to own land. Remember, Anarchy is simply the absence of an entity with a license to do violence. One can have land rights without violence. Anarchy is not the absence of organization, contract, groups or rules. In your first example, one of the farmers got there first and began farming first. That farmer would have an earlier fundamental right to the water supply. The second farmer, therefore, would need to reach an agreement with whoever was there before him before altering the state of affairs. But, even if we assume that the two farmers simultaneously arrived on the scene and each wanted to alter the land in a mutually exclusive fashion, there isn’t anything about the scenario that prevents them from hiring a 3rd party arbiter to settle the dispute. Each farmer agrees to be bound by the decision of the arbiter, presents his case, and the arbiter decides and is paid for the service. If you think this sounds untenable, realize the system the United States now enjoys. One of the farmers goes to a local thug, convinces him of the justice of his cause, and the thug then issues a fancy document to the first farmer indicating that violence will be done against his person or property if he doesn’t show up and argue his case. Which of the two seems more civilized?

In your second scenario, again, one of them was there first. But, secondarily, the farmer is simply liable for the ecological damage he causes to another’s property. He has several options available to him. First, he could enter an agreement with the woman allowing him to pollute her land with mosquitoes in exchange for a sum of rice. Second, he could farmer in such a way to eliminate the mosquitoes, or their ability to leave his property. Third, he could choose not to farm rice. There are, of course, other options, but I’m sure you get the idea.

Anarchy must allow for personal property that is, at least, closely similar to our current concept of property. After all, nothing can be produced without occupying some amount of space. If nothing can be produced, no one could own any property. More fundamentally, all mankind needs food to live. I know of no way to produce food that doesn’t require either a) some land or b) some dirt. If people cannot own the means of their own survival, they cannot have stability or civilization.

### Dekeken says (2010-09-14 4:00pm)

Good response.

I suppose it would take a fundamental change in culture in order for anarchy to work. Most Americans are operating under the attitude of entitlement and absolute personal gratification. In order for anarchy to work there would have to be more of a culture of community and community well being i.e. If I keep mosquitoes from driving away tourists than your hotel will prosper making our general community a more profitable and pleasant place; with the possible side effect that more people will want to move to California after visiting your delightful hotel and produce more customers to buy my rice.

As far as your argument about land needed for production. I agree there can be no production and therefore no ownership without land. But with land comes the most potential for conflict. It is not necessary for there to be individual ownership of land for it to be of use for production. In fact it would be better in most cases if land was shared because then I can freely move to land that is the best for farming and either contribute to the land cultivation that is going on there or start my own; or I can freely move to land that would be better for industry, or tourism ect. without the need for constant arbitration (which I believe would lead to an industry of arbitration which could easily jump to the level of organized and violent government).

In short in order for anarchy to work there must be a cultural change to that of community wellbeing as apposed to exclusively individual well being. And sharing land is a good way to avoid the conflicts inherent in individual land ownership.

### Thales says (2010-09-14 6:33pm)

Would it take a fundamental change in culture? I don’t think so, not unless you consider philosophy and values a part of culture. If you do, then I agree.

I agree that land has the greatest potential for conflict, as it tends to be the most nebulous of properties to own. For instance, does one own the volume of space above the land in question? If so, how high? Does one own the ground underneath? How far down? What about the air that flows over the land? Difficult questions to answer, and people generally have assumptions about the answers and those assumptions can lead to conflict.

I agree that it may be that production is benefitted by shared ownership. Libertarian principles neither prescribe nor proscribe group ownership – if people want to do that, fine.

As far as land being shared, I disagree that it is ‘better’ until you more completely define your criteria for ‘better’. It sounds to me like what you really need is an easement agreement with surrounding property owners. Perhaps I misunderstand your meaning.

And yes, you’re right, anarchic systems generally create a market for arbitration and legal services. Those services need not be violent – one could easily source a security firm independent of arbitration. Why do you believe that an arbitration industry would easily become violent government?

### Dekeken says (2010-09-15 4:07pm)

Philosophy and values are determined by culture or are integral components to culture depending on which way you look at it.

I think our disagreement comes from a difference in perception of the natural disposition of people and their ability to change. If you believe, as I do, that people are predisposed to violence and are innately self serving then the kind of society you are describing would require a deep change in nature by every individual.

When I say that arbitration industry would naturally turn to violent is because of the above belief. If you are an arbitrator then it is most profitable for there to be conflict so you would try to create conflict. The more conflict the greater need for arbitration. Eventually it would become efficient and profitable to set up standard rules or laws that all groups would be bound by if they wan’t to reconcile their problems. It wouldn’t take much form that point for the arbitration industry to become formalized and enforce their arbitration with violence standing as pre-established authority in all conflicts.

I do admit that people can be reasonable and seek personal gain through the greater good but I don’t know how well that would go over coming from our current society.

### Thales says (2010-09-15 7:53pm)

I don’t think you actually believe that people are predisposed to violence. If you did, you would endeavor, constantly, to protect yourself. Do you carry a weapon with you? Do you have any sort of martial training? If not, do you at least stay away from people, who are predisposed to attack? If you believe people are predisposed to violence, what do you think keeps that in check (or do you routinely encounter violence?)? After all, say you believe all people are predisposed to violence, and only some outward force keeps that violence in check. You can’t hire anyone to protect you unless you have absolute certainty that you control the power that controls the violence, otherwise your protectors will take by force whatever you use to hire them. Because violence can modify behavior and property rights, generally the only way to control violent people is through the implementation of violence. If you try to control them with a behavior, they can use violence to modify your behavior. If you try to control them with property, they can use violence to take your property. Therefore, violence is the only way to control violence. Do you control the majority of those around you with violence?

As for people being innately self-serving, there is nothing about self-interest that runs counter to an organized and polite society. Most people consider Jesus a good example of someone who is altruistic. He is, also, innately self-serving. He claims to act out of love for his fellow man. Serving that affection serves his own purposes because his love informs his purposes. Look at it another way: does a parent care for a child because he genuinely wants to serve the needs of another being, or because he loves the child? They sound like nearly the same thing, but one is innately self-serving because of one’s feelings of love. The fact that you would choose to help your family rather than help a random group of individuals is because you are self-serving. That doesn’t make charity bad, it simply helps us to know why you help your family instead of someone else’s. You serve them because you love them. You choose to help the object of your love rather than some other random thing because you are self-serving. In this instance, serving your feelings of love.

As for your argument about arbitration, I agree that there is definitely incentive for a private arbitration firm to create conflict to increase its own business. However, since an arbitration firms business is settling conflict, this is much like the argument about plumbers creating leaky pipes. Would there be plumbers who create leaky pipes? Absolutely. Do all plumbers create leaky pipes to enhance their own business opportunities? No.

I believe that part of your contention lies in the fact that it is extremely difficult to imagine a system of anarchy and how it would work. Some people say “Before I buy in to anarchy, explain how X currently governmental activity would work”. To quote Walter Block, if I could perfectly describe how such a system would work, that alone, the act of describing it, would be the greatest argument in favor of centralization. If a single person can conceive of the system, define how it would work, how it would handle all contingencies and problems, etc, that person would be the best person to be the dictator over said system. However, the contention in favor of a free market approach to things like police and arbitration is that the complex interaction of thousands or millions of people will produce a system that is vastly superior to a monolithicly dictated system. Well, that, and the fact that it is a principled approach that honors the freedom of men.

Which reminds me of my final argument in favor of anarchy. Would you kill a baby to protect another baby? Would you kill a baby to protect ten? Would you kill a baby to protect a million? At what point does it become acceptable to destroy one person in favor of many people? At what point are you willing to sacrifice the rights of one person to serve the good of others. How much evil would you willingly accept into your own life in exchange for some material gain? To a principled person (one whose principles value human life and eschew evil, of course) the answer is none. If you honor principles you don’t make exceptions. Principled people who hold rights to be innate, self-evident and inviolate cannot support a government that violates rights. It doesn’t matter if they can’t think of a better way, it doesn’t matter if they are afraid of the alternatives. The principle comes first. The consequences are then dealt with second.

If, on the other hand, you don’t believe in principles but are an unswerving pragmatist, I have no idea why you’re reading this blog. I’d appreciate some enlightenment.

### Dekeken says (2010-09-17 at 7:40pm)

You are right, I don’t believe people to be predisposed to violence, I regretted writing that as soon as I published my response. I guess a better way to put it is that it is very easy for a person to trip over circumstance into violence. Violence is a much simpler response because it takes very little thought and can be tantalizingly effective.

Now to clarify; I don’t hold any judgment on anarchy as to whether it is right or wrong. I can’t say whether it is possible to transition directly from our current system and culture to one of anarchy although, probably because of the ideas you stated above, I think it unlikely.

However, I would like to take it a little deeper and address your second to last paragraph. Your statements caused me to think very deeply about the way things are and how they should be.

First you argue that principled people are driven by the desire to protect other their and other peoples’ rights. Well no one has right(s) plural. We only have one absolute right and that is the right to make choices. We don’t have a right to happiness, property, liberty, or even to life. These are all said to be innate or God-given rights but this idea is a deception and frankly wrong.

This is my reasoning. If God means these to be inalienable rights he necessarily would have to afford all people the power to obtain and exercise these rights. It is obvious that he has made no such guarantee. As much as you work and prepare to protect your rights, your property can be taken from you, you can be enslaved, those whom you love the most can die from disease, or you yourself can die at anytime and are powerless to stop it.

We do have the right to choose and this is very important. With this right we can change everything. It is this right alone that gives us power.

So if we only have the right to choose what of the other “rights” we seem to think we are privileged to? Well the answer is that these are objectified responsibilities. With the right to choose we are given the responsibility to choose the correct path (the one of principle that you referred to). We are given the responsibility to help other people. We are given the responsibility to care for those that we love. We are given the responsibility to do well with what God has given us.

The concept of inalienable rights was created to allow us to justify our behaviour concerning these responsibilities. When we are denied the opportunity to fulfill these responsibilities it is much easier to say we have a right to behave in a certain way in order to fulfill that responsibility. But it is just a farce, we have the right to choose what we will do when our attempts to fulfill those responsibilities are frustrated, but nevertheless no matter what our choice is we can still be foiled and fail. But that is okay because we made a choice and we will be reckoned according to our choices and not to the ultimate fulfillment of our responsibilities. Why not our responsibilities, because no matter what we do our families can be torn from us and brutalized, the gifts God has given us can be desecrated, we can be enslaved and lose the power to do almost anything, all things are outside our control except choice.

How does this fit into anarchy? It makes life much more simple; we should do things because it is the right thing to do. Sometimes in order to fulfill our responsibilities choosing to live outside of organized government is the right thing to do. Sometimes in order to protect our families and fulfill our responsibilities supporting a top heavy government is the right thing to do.

Our only right is the right to choose, and no matter the outside condition, peaceful or chaotic, this right gives us the power to do good and fulfill our responsibilities; let the consequence follow.

### Thales says (2010-09-17 at 8:15pm)

I’ll agree, speaking of the absolute nature of man, people only have their free will. But, what is the point of speaking from that standpoint? We might as well say that the sky is blue, and never speak again. We all know what our physical limitations are. The reason I speak of rights is because I wish to speak about what is justifiable, what is legally codifiable into a coherent system. You say that we can simplify things by simply dictating that we all do what is right. How do we determine what is right? How do we determine it in such a way that it can be codified into law?

Once we get to the point that we are codifying moral behavior, we have two diverging paths. On the one, we can have sharia law – the belief that people will do the right thing by following some uncodified religious notion of right and wrong. The problem with that path is it’s ridiculously easy to abuse. All one has to do is become a religious leader and one can then dictate what is right and wrong. The other path is to codify certain behaviors as wrong. But, as you eloquently put it, a given action (“supporting a top heavy government”) can be moral or amoral depending on circumstance. We therefore can’t reliably codify behaviors as legally right or wrong if our basis for an action being legal is whether or not it is morally good. An example:

The law dictates that you may not kill, because killing is wrong.
A man attacks your family. You defend you and yours, lethally.
Your action is (arguably) morally justified. However, it is not legally justified.

At this point, you either a) must punish a morally just action because it is not legally just, b) alter the law by adding a clause that allows for defense. This will be repeated for every single morally justifiable action that isn’t yet codified or c) empower an arbitrary person to decide legal justification.

Given these options, I would choose ‘a’, with the caveat that I would then codify a system of law that minimizes the possibility of illegal, morally good actions. My discussion of Anarchy is my description of such a system.

In the end, I agree whole-heartedly with you. Law itself does nothing. The fact that murder is illegal just about everywhere doesn’t stop people from doing it. What law does do is create a system whereby people may judge each other. It can then become a basis for order. Order is a basis for societal interaction. Societal interaction and order yields many material benefits for the members of the society. Therefore, discussing law is a useful tool to creating a better society, but only insofar as you can convince people to buy into the legal system. Because, in the end, as you said, everyone must choose to follow whatever you convince them of.
