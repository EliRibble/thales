A yodabyte is pretty huge from what I gather. Does the human brain have a yodabyte of capacity?

Absolutely.

Apathetic response.

It was a yes or no question. Thales answered the question.

Thanks for answering my question. It was sufficient for me. It amazes me that that can be possible. I guess that it makes sense though. I was thinking of remembering every e-mail sent and received but really every day experience includes huge amounts of information. Colors and relationships to items, events and complex situations all include large amounts of information that can be recalled on demand. So, maybe I am not memorizing trillions of e-mails but I am processing similar amounts of information in a different form.
