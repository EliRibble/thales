Thomas, your desire for education is probably admirable. I say ‘probably’ because I really have no idea why you’re going to school. Far too many people go because it’s the next prescribed step in life. But, assuming you want to increase your useful knowledge and learn something that can be directly translated into money, it’s admirable. Anyone who tells you that education is worth it just to ‘be educated’ or ‘broaden your horizons’ only wants to hurt you. You could go to school for years to learn about Pokemon – no one would care, except the people taking your tuition money, and Nintendo. Many degrees out there are functionally equivalent. Don’t pursue them.

That said, recently the government has become [decidedly more socialist](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36106210/ns/us_news-education/), so your options are fewer. How recently? With some exceptions, about 200 years. You may be interested to learn about [what kind of socialist](http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/what-kind-of-socialist-is-barack-obama--15421) Pres. Obama is, considering he recently signed a bill that changes your options even further.

In the end, the question is a matter of how cheap your self-respect is. There are student loans that are backed by private institutions, though few, which could almost retain your self-respect. These loans are made by institutions borrowing other people’s money with the understanding that they will use that money to make money. Ergo, fine for you to borrow under their terms. Such institutions are generally FDIC insured, which is unfortunate since they are inherently taking money from people unwillingly to provide that insurance, but difficult to avoid in America.

The next option is student loans from the government, which is entirely funded through confiscated assets. But, at least you’ll pay that back, eventually, unless you go into a government-sanctioned job, like murder/international posturing or brainwashing (ie, military & public education) and pay back slowly. So, you have the opportunity to at least look like a man when you’re done.

The final option is grants, which equates to you taking money from hundreds to thousands of unwilling tax-payers to fund your foray into the rigors of institutionalized, self-guided reprogramming. In exchange for proving that you are either less-desireable or less-competent than a particular percentage of the populace, you can have hired goons steal goods and give them to your university on your behalf. You maintain no self-respect on this option, and should you pursue it I would hope you’d never visit this blog again.

In the end, aside from a very small subsection of highly skilled engineering positions, you are likely to succeed far more in life if you are motivated and spend 5 years getting experience in your chosen field rather than waste time and money at a university. Degrees are a way of ‘proving’ that you have the requisite skills for a position without actually having to demonstrate said skills. If a company takes your word, or your university’s word, on your abilities, you don’t want to work for them anyways. They will be full of mediocre people who think paper is as good as reality. Find somewhere that wants to see what you can do before they will pay you, and you will be happier and more successful, and so will they.

Thales,

I value your the advice that you gave Thomas because it address the question that I have, but is not adequate for my situation.

First off, I would like to be a man of self respect.
I work hard in construction for a little over minimum wage. Most of my money goes to support my mom and 6 siblings none of which have jobs. I have made mistakes and dropped out of high school, but I long to be educated and successful.

Last week I visited a councilor about going to college, the outlook was grim for me. I don’t qualify for any private loans and I don’t qualify for private grants or scholarships because I calculate out as a poor investment. I worked it out and it would take me 30 years of working part time and going to school part time to graduate. No one in my community has the capacity or desire to help me go to college.

I would like to maintain my integrity and avoid the ample government options, Thales would you be willing to fund my education personally or even put a thousand dollars towards it? If not wise and well meaning people like you then who?

I commend you for your adherence to principles of virtue.

The big question is, why do you calculate out as a poor investment to private funding? Have you asked? After all, if you’re a poor investment for them, why wouldn’t you be a poor investment for me?

I’m a charitable man, but it does neither of us any good for me to dole out charity to you and for you to consume my hard-earned fiat currency if you are ill-prepared for schooling. Make a better case – how do I know you will assimilate the information taught? How do I know you will do something useful with it? What evidences do you have of your character that give me the confidence that I need to have faith in you?

Begging comes easily to mankind. You, begging now, tells me only that you are aware of your need. Show me that you are aware of something more, that you can see things from the perspective of another, that you have a plan for the future.

After all, you are asking me to rob my children in your favor. I may do it, but I will not do it for pity. I will do it because I choose to honor you, and what you are making of yourself.
